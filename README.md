# CS5830 - Big Data Laboratory

This repository contains a collection of assignments completed as part of CS5830 - Big Data Laboratory. 

## Assignments

### 1. Digit Classification via Hand-coded ML Pipeline and Accuracy Monitoring
In this assignment, we build a hand-coded machine learning pipeline for digit classification using the MNIST dataset. We will also implement a monitoring system to track the model's accuracy over time.

### 2. Data Engineering Pipeline using Apache Airflow
This assignment involves setting up a data engineering pipeline using Apache Airflow. We will create two DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs): one for data fetching and another for analytics.

### 4. Dataset Consistency Verification and Version Control
In this assignment, we will set up a pipeline to verify the consistency of a dataset. We will also learn how to use Data Version Control (DVC) and Git for source control and experiment tracking.

### 5. Model Building Experiment Tracking with MLflow
This assignment focuses on tracking model building experiments using MLflow. We learn how to log metrics, parameters, and artifacts during the model training process, and visualize the experiments using the MLflow UI.

### 6. MNIST Digit Prediction with FastAPI
In this assignment, you will build a FastAPI application for MNIST digit prediction. Users can upload an image of a handwritten digit, and the API will return the predicted digit value.
